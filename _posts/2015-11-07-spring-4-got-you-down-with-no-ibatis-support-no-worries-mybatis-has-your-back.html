title: Spring 4 got you down with no ibatis support - no worries Mybatis has your
  back
---

Spring is well on it's way to leaving 3 behind.&nbsp; For ibatis users that for one reason or another are stuck to ibatis, but want to just make the jump to spring 4, there is a dilemma.&nbsp; This dilemma roots in the fact that spring team dropped ibatis in spring 4.&nbsp; Until now this meant that upgrading to spring 4 required upgrading ibatis to mybatis and mybatis-spring.&nbsp; Well in order to mitigate risk to those that need it, mybatis team has decided to extract the spring 3 ibatis support into a new mybatis project called 'mybatis-2-spring'.&nbsp; Better still, we go one step further and have released a fresh copy of 'mybatis-2'.&nbsp; So there you have it, all of the users out there dealing with legacy code, mybatis is no longer directly tied into the mix resulting in higher risk in upgrading.&nbsp; With that said, enjoy what's left in the ibatis land as we resurrect the past.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Jeremy Landis and MyBatis Team
